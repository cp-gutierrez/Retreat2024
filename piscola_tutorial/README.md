# PISCOLA Tutorial
___

## Requirements

It is recommended to use an environment to install PISCOLA. All the requirements for this tutorial are in the `requirements.txt` file.

```python
conda create -n tutorial pip  # environment called 'tutorial'
conda activate tutorial
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note that the PISCOLA version used it `2.0.0rc1`, which is a release candidate and therefore not installed simply with `pip install piscola`.
